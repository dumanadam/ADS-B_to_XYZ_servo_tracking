# ADS-B to XYZ servo tracking for pan and tilt systems
A project to receive ADS-B signals from aircraft using an SDR or similar radio. The data should be received in JSON format which this will then be converted to tracking points in the sky. This could be used for tracking system in pan and tilt camera systems or as a tracker for your nephew like I will be doing. Currently uses the WifiManager library to create an AP that can be connected to wirelessly. Details will include 3d printing models so a self contained mini unit running on an 18650 battery , tp4056 and a toy laser can be made.

Hardware used and more information will be updated on the blog [here](https://talha.me/)
